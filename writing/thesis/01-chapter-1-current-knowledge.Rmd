## Two-eyed seeing: Recognizing Traditional Indigenous Knowledge

The ancestral and traditional Knowledge of Indigenous and colonized Peoples is often dismissed, ignored, and contradicted by Western institutions [@smith_decolonizing_2012]. **...** The development of Western science is often assumed to clash with the sacred Knowledge many colonized People hold. Western science is also often viewed as more objective, methodical, and unbiased than traditional Knowledge, and as such it is believed by Western institutions to be superior to Indigenous Knowledge [@smith_decolonizing_2012]. However, it is common for Western institutions to (reluctantly) reach similar, if not identical, conclusions as those held by Indigenous people [@ref]. The refusal to recognize traditional Knowledge and cooperate with non-Western institutions often results in a loss of time, resources, and funds to the Western institutions and severe damage to the Land the institution operated on, as well as to the people who's ancestors inhabited the region for millennia. The development of Western science at the exclusion of Indigenous Peoples perpetuates colonialism and brings harm all parties involved. <!-- *damage to generations to come* -->

The concept of *two-eye seeing* [@ref] refers to an approach to knowledge and growth that braids Indigenous Knowledge and science together with Western science [@kutz_two-eyed_2019; @kimmerer_braiding_2020]. Since Traditional Indigenous Knowledge tends to be qualitative, while biological sciences tend to be quantitative, connecting the two is not always simple. One possibility, however, is to use Traditional Knowledge to create well-informed Bayesian priors [@ref]. The validity of the priors can be ensured using prior predictive modeling to select priors that align with the Traditional Knowledge. This practice is not new [@girondot_bayesian_2015; @belisle_local_2018], but it is rarely used, despite it aligning well with the philosophy of Bayesian statistics.

## "Non-Indigenous academic knowledge"?

- spend time reading papers initially to do a review, get a review paper out of it
- make predictions/hypotheses for project
- what influences stochasticity: what is it and what is affecting it
- very little testing has been done on effects of stochasticity

<!-- write paragraph(s) on energetics -->

<!-- don't use tau for generation times because it's used for autocorrelation parameters -->

Animals with short generation times (e.g., mice) are more likely to be be severely impacted by a stochastic event than larger animals (e.g. elephants) since larger animals can have bigger energy reserves, and larger animals tend to have longer generation times, which allows them to develop memory about the frequency of such events [@elephants-and-droughts-ref].

See figures in *Southwood 1977*

*Southwood 1977*:
- *durational stability* of a habitat (period favorable for reproduction and survival): $H = F + L$; number of generations per period: $H / \tau$
- in stable environments (i.e., with low to no stochasticity), $H >> \tau \implies$ organisms perceive $H \rightarrow \infty$ 
- greater survival of the residents may simply derive from their knowledge of the geography of the habitat with the corresponding advantages for feeding and predator avoidance, noticed in animals ranging from Heliconius butterflies (Gilbert 1975; Cook, Thomason & Young 1976) to primates (MacKinnon 1974).
- Cope's law? (Southwood et al. 1974, see Southwood 1977)
- animals living in an area with high temporal stochasticity should ehibit more polymorhpism to be able to adapt to unpredictable habitats (Southwood 1977). In areas where temporal stochasticity has or will increase as a result of climate change, we expect species will need to adopt new behaviors or become more polymorphic to survive.

Environmental productivity is tightly linked to the amount of space that animals need to cover to obtain the resources they needed to survive and reproduce[@lucherini_habitat_1996; @relyea_home_2000]. While resource availability is often considered in conservation decision-making, an environment's heterogeneity, stochasticity, and how the two change over time are rarely accounted for. In addition, environmental stochasticity, including extreme events, can reduce a landscape's energetic balance[@chevin_adaptation_2010], which, in turn, would decrease animals' fitness. Therefore, we expect animals living in unpredictable environments to require more space than those in stable environments (Fig. 1). Although this hypothesis is supported by a few recent studies[@morellet_seasonality_2013; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019; @riotte-lambert_environmental_2020], many of them are limited in their analytical depth and geographic and taxonomic scales, so there remains a need for developing a more complete understanding of how animals' spatial needs change with environmental stochasticity. These stresses are compounded by climate change, which exposes species to increasingly common stochastic events[@ipcc_global_2018]. Furthermore, anthropogenic structures reduce the habitat available to terrestrial species[@wilson_habitat_2016], who struggle to move in fragmented[@fahrig_non-optimal_2007], human-dominated landscapes[@tucker_moving_2018]. As the impacts of habitat loss and climate change will worsen in the future[@ipcc_global_2018; @hansen_high-resolution_2013], it is imperative that we better understand spatial requirements of taxa to protect wildlife existence and biodiversity. Environmental safeguarding is also essential for Reconciliation with Indigenous People in Canada [@truth_and_reconciliation_commission_of_canada_honouring_2015].

## Timescale of stochasticity

Organisms are most affected by stochastic events and processes which occur on time scales which are shorter than the organism's life span [@ref]. Weekly heavy rains which alter a lake's salinity [@ref] are more likely to affect the lake's inhabitants than a multi-centennial drought, and high-salinity conditions may be perceived as the (stressful) standard by organisms which were born during periods of drought. However, stochastic processes and events which occur on time scales that are longer than an organism's lifespan may still cause significant effects on a population's fitness and stability. Droughts which occur on the time scale of centuries or millennia (@haig_assessment_2013) are unlikely to affect organisms directly, but such events could still alter the population's habitat or breeding grounds enough to cause a population collapse or prevent individuals from reproducing in their habitual breeding grounds (or reproduce altogether).

For an event or process to be recognized as deterministic by an individual, it must occur multiple times during the individual's lifetime (but the converse is not true). *some animals can develop memory* [@foley_severe_2008]

Trees that have drought resilience have higher mortality [@desoto_low_2020] *check the stats & causation from this reference*

## Simulations

Look at mechanistic models & energetics

Include:

* effects of animal mass,
* resistance to/ease of movement (e.g., wolves and clear-cut gas lines)
* "state-space model" with 2 spaces: within a patch (slow-moving) and between patches (faster movement)

See `R` packages for meta-community simulations
