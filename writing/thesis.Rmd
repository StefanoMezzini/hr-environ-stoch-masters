# Introduction

- spend time reading papers initially to do a review, get a review paper out of it
- make preditions/hypotheses for project
- what influences stochasticity: what is it and what is affecting it
- very little testing has been done on effects of stochasticity

# Methods

<!-- - look at HPAMs? -->

# Evnironmental stochasticity map

- currently don't have a raster of stochasticity => paper / product
- PCA on main drivers/causes of stochasticity

# Movement analysis

- add HFI to analysis

# Synthesis chapter
<!-- why is this  work important? so what? now what?-->
