There may only be one abstract for the entire thesis. -->

```{r}
abstract <- "The ability to move allows animals to access more resources and decrease the risk of mortality or injury from various threats, including predation and competition. However, most motile animals depend on movement to achieve an energetic balance, survive, and reproduce. Animals' spatial needs depend on a multidute of factors, including resource abundance, competitive pressure, predation, weather, and climate. The effects of many of these factors have been studied extensively, but the effects of environmental heterogeneity and unpredictability remain largely understudied. This thesis aims to quantify how resource abundance and environmental variation affect animals' spatial needs using theoretical arguments, computational simulations, and a large animal movement dataset of over 1500 individuals from more than 75 species. To this end, this thesis will produce a new global measure of environmental variance which will be used to quantify the effect of environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity on animals' spatial needs while accounting for spatiotemporal trends and correlations within populations and species. The animals' movement will be modeled using continuous-time stochastic movement models. The effects of environmental variance on animal's spatial needs will be estimated using hierarchical generalized additive models that account for common trends between taxonomic groups and populations. The work will be carried out within a framework that recognizes the value of different forms of knowledge, including Traditional Indigenous Knowledge, and it will incorporate Traditional Indigenous Knowledge when possible. Overall, I expect spatial needs to be lower in areas with higher resource abundance and lower environmental variance. However, I also expect the effects of resource abundance and environmental variance to depend on the species and ecosystems of interest. Thus, the average trends between species may not be representative of individual populations and species."

# Foreword {-}

## Two-eyed seeing: Recognizing Traditional Indigenous Knowledge {-}

The lands managed and protected by Indigenous Peoples are often markedly different from those inhabited by urban societies. While recognizing that there is great diversity between Indigenous Peoples (as well as other colonized Peoples), it is important to recognize that many hold great knowledge on how to live sustainably, safeguard environments, and protect biodiversity [@schuster_vertebrate_2019], and have been doing so for millennia. Yet, their leaders and representatives are seldom included in conservation-related decision-making. Instead, many Western institutions often dismiss, ignore, and contradict the ancestral and traditional Knowledge of Indigenous and colonized Peoples [@smith_decolonizing_2021; @kimmerer_braiding_2020]. The development of Western science is frequently assumed to clash with the (often sacred) Knowledge many colonized People hold. Western science is often viewed as more objective, methodical, and unbiased than traditional Knowledge, and as such Western institutions and people often consider it to be superior to Indigenous Knowledge [@smith_decolonizing_2021]. However, it is common for Western institutions to (reluctantly) reach similar, if not identical, conclusions as those held by Indigenous people [@bennett_evidence_2021; @smith_decolonizing_2021; @kimmerer_braiding_2020]. The refusal to recognize traditional Knowledge and cooperate with non-Western institutions often results in a loss of time, resources, and funds to the Western institutions and severe damage to the Land the institution operated on, as well as to the people who's ancestors inhabited the region for millennia [@smith_decolonizing_2021]. The development of Western science at the exclusion of Indigenous Peoples perpetuates colonialism and brings harm all parties involved.

The concept of *two-eye seeing* refers to an approach to knowledge and growth that braids Indigenous Knowledge and science together with Western science [@kutz_two-eyed_2019; @kimmerer_braiding_2020]. Since Traditional Indigenous Knowledge tends to be qualitative, while biological sciences tend to be quantitative, connecting the two is not always simple [@bowles_threepronged_2021]. One possibility, however, is to use Traditional Knowledge to create properly informed Bayesian priors [@bolstad_introduction_2017]. The validity of the priors can be ensured using prior predictive modeling [@mcelreath_statistical_2016] to select priors that align with the Traditional Knowledge. This practice is not new [@girondot_bayesian_2015; @belisle_local_2018], but it is rarely used, despite it aligning well with the philosophy of Bayesian statistics.

Although this project does not focus on Indigenous Knowledge or Data, I intend to carryout the work with an anti-imperial and anti-colonial stance, to combat problematic and questionable practices and views (rather than risking perpetuating them). I recognize my ignorance in the field in the hopes of receiving valuable critiques, direction, and suggestions. During the project, I intend connecting with local Indigenous groups and Nations (including Westbank First Nation) to offer help in related fields and exchange knowledge (while recognizing that I do not have the right to all knowledge and that many forms and sources of Knowledge are sacred). Regardless of whether collaborations will be possible, I will actively work on removing any form of colonial bias in my work and perspectives while also combating colonialism, imperialism, and other forms of oppression.
