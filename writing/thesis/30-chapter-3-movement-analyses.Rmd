# Chapter 3: Movement analyses {#movement-analyses}

## Movement simulations

- Inform priors and simulation distributions using Indigenous Traditional Knowledge

## Stochasticity map

- currently there's no raster of stochasticity => paper / product
- PCA on main drivers/causes of stochasticity

## Movement analysis

### Model types {#model-types}

- add HFI to analysis (but it's temporally static)
- define and describe:
  - IID model
  - OU anisotropic, isotropic
  - OUF anisotropic, isotropic,
  - OUf anisotropic
- look at HPAMs?
