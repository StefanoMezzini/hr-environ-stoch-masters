# Chapter 2: A new measure of environmental variance

Whether an animal is affected by or can perceive environmental variance depends strongly on the spatiotemporal scale of the process(es) involved. Processes that occur at very small scales (e.g., the location of electrons around atoms) or very large scales (e.g., the movement of the Milky Way) are unlikely to be have an effect or be detected. Thus, the scale at which we quantify variance should depend on the spatiotemporal scale and sensitivity of the animals being studied. Since this project focuses on medium to large animals, I will focus on processes and events which occur on the temporal scale of hours to decades and spatial scale of meters to kilometers. I will assume small-scale variances such as heterogeneity in grass density at the centimeter scale or fluctuations in temperature over the span of a few minutes have no (measurable) effect on the spatial needs of the animals which I will be studying. Even if such small-scale variances had an effect, such an effect would be hard to detect or quantify because: (1) the effect size would be small (so large amounts of data would be necessary for an appreciable result), and (2) the uncertainty in the tracking data limits the precision at which one is able to detect changes in movement in response to such small variation (figure \@ref(fig:heterogeneity)). Thus, it seems reasonable to quantify environmental variance at the scale of minutes to days and meters to kilometers.

To my knowledge, there currently is no large-scale measurement of environmental variance. Producing a worldwide raster of such a measure would allow people to estimate the spatial temporal variance of an animal's habitat and better understand how heterogeneity and unpredictability affect its home range, as well when and why animals may decide to migrate or become nomadic. Some measures of environmental heterogeneity already exist, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI; @ndvi-ref] and the machine learning human footprint index (ml-HFI) produced by @keys_machine-learning_2021. However, neither of these indices provides a comprehensive measure of environmental variance over the years. Such a measure should account for the spatiotemporal variance in frequent events (e.g., precipitation) and continuous processes (e.g., temperature) as well as the frequency of extreme and rare events (e.g., fires, cyclones).

How the frequency and average intensity of events are estimated depends on the event(s) considered. Processes for which we have an abundance of worldwide data, such as daily air temperature and precipitation can be included as raw data, and their variances can be estimated using smooth location-scale models, such as GAMs with appropriate conditional distributions [i.e., Gaussian location-scale for temperature and Gamma location-scale for precipitation; see @stasinopoulos_generalized_2007; @umlauf_bamlss_2018]. In contrast, the frequency of rare events should be modeled with more smooth (i.e., less wiggly) models, since the low data availability does not allow us to use models with high degrees of freedom [i.e., very wiggly predictors; see @simpson_modelling_2018].

The effects of environmental variance on home range size have been quantified by some small-scale studies [e.g., @lucherini_habitat_1996; @rizzuto_forage_2021], but I was unable to find any large-scale study which estimated the effect of environmental stochasticity beyond the population or species scale.

<!-- quantify levels and stability of green light wave (see NDVI) with and without human modification/activity. model interaction of NDVI and ml-HFI? but risk over-fitting and creating spurious correlations and models hard to interpret. -->

- currently there's no raster of stochasticity
- PCA on main drivers/causes of stochasticity
- ml-HFI would be useful, but it's static
- can use NDVI, but it only starts in ~2000. however, if it correlates strongly with temperature and precip we could extrapolate out of the ranges

## Environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity

<!-- Organisms are most affected by stochastic events and processes which occur on time scales which are in the order of the organisms' life spans or generation times [@southwood_habitat_1977]. Weekly heavy rains which alter a lake's salinity [@ref] are more likely to affect an individual than a multi-centennial drought, and the high salinity that follows the drought may be perceived as the (stressful) standard by individuals which were born during the drought. In contrast, organisms can adapt to unpredictable heavy rains if they occur on a daily frequency. However, stochastic processes and events which occur on time scales that are longer than an organism's lifespan may still cause significant effects on a population's fitness and stability. Droughts which occur on the time scale of centuries or millennia [@haig_assessment_2013] are unlikely to affect organisms directly, but such events could still alter the population's habitat or breeding grounds enough to cause a population collapse or prevent individuals from reproducing in their habitual breeding region (or reproduce altogether). -->

There are many sources of environmental change over both time and space. Some are due to repetitive, predictable, or even well-known patterns (such as daily or seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation or the location of different patches), while others are due to infrequent, unpredictable, or poorly-understood events (such as forest fires, the arrival of new competitors, or human activity). In this thesis, I will refer to predictable or known changes in space and time as environmental *heterogeneity*, while I will use the term *stochasticity* specifically for unpredictable (spatiotemporal) variation. Examples of heterogeneity include known spatial variation between patches of variation, or expected changes in temperature throughout the day. In contrast, the spatial distribution of food in a new environment may be perceived stochastic (at least at first), since it is unpredictable. Similarly, changes in temperature ranges, precipitation, and the frequency of extreme events due to climate change [@ipcc_global_2018; @noonan_situ_2018] are examples of stochasticity rather than temporal heterogeneity. Other unpredictable extreme events such as forest fires and floods also constitute sources of stochasticity.

Generally, events are predictable when (1) they occur with a probability density that is approximately constant over time and space, (2) they occur frequently within an organism's generation time or lifespan, and (3) they occur frequently enough to be expected as normal (e.g., rain in rainforests). (Note that the variance of a Bernoulli random variable $Y$ is maximized when $P(Y = 1) = p = 0.5 \implies \mathbb V(Y) = p\,(1-p) = 0.25$, and minimized when the event occurs almost never ($p \approx 0$) or or almost always ($p \approx 1$), since now $\mathbb V(Y)\approx 0 (1-0) = 1 (1-1) = 0$. Thus, events which occur extremely rarely, such as meteor impacts, are predictably infrequent and often assumed not to occur.) When an event occurs fairly frequently (e.g., $0.3 < p < 0.5$), animals may begin to expect the event to occur and consider it normality (figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-changing)a), as long as the change in frequency and magnitude is sufficiently gradual. For instance, @lamont_fire_2020 found that serotiny (the storage of seeds in closed cones or fruits which open following a fire) is common in plant populations which suffer fires at least once per lifespan, on average. However, the trait becomes less common if the fires become so common that plants survive more often as resprouters than by producing seeds. If a dangerous event such as fires becomes more frequent, unpredictable, or severe, organisms may store resources in favorable times and locations so they can resist more adverse times, and mobile animals may move to avoid avoid such events altogether [@southwood_habitat_1977; @lindstedt_seasonality_1985]. However, variety in fires may increase environmental heterogeneity and promote biodiversity [@fuhlendorf_application_2004], particularly shortly after fires occur and when fires produce heterogeneous burns [@tingley_pyrodiversity_2016], but the effects of fire can differ between ecosystems [@koerner_small-scale_2013].

The timescale over which an event is (un)predictable will also play a key role in determining how species respond, or not, to stochasticity. Adverse events which occur frequently during an organism's generation time or lifespan (e.g., at least twice, on average) may be considered as threats worth preparing for. Stochastic and destructive events which happen frequently can become part of an organism's habitat and life history, so organisms may either adapt to their occurrence and even learn to predict them [@foley_severe_2008], or they may avoid the risk altogether by moving to a new habitat [@southwood_habitat_1977]. If habitats are (or become) unfavorable, animals may move to a new habitat, migrate seasonally [@geremia_migrating_2019], or simply prefer nomadism over range residency [e.g., @nandintsetseg_variability_2019]. It is unclear when animals switch from range residency to nomadism (or vice-versa), but understanding the connection between the two types of movement is important for quantifying the effect of spatiotemporal stochasticity on animal's spatial needs. From a quantitative perspective, the switch is related to an animal's positional autocorrelation over time (also known as home range crossing time, here indicate as $\tau_p$). Animals without a constant home home range (i.e., without a constant centroid) will spend more time away from the overall mean position, so the time required to crossing their entire range time will be large.

Adverse events which are too infrequent (e.g., $p < 0.1$) may not be perceived as a reoccurring threat, so organisms may be unable to adapt appropriately. Instead, highly infrequent events are more likely to perceived as an oddity rather than something work preparing for. In contrast, highly stochastic events (e.g., $p \approx 0.5$ or if $p$ changes unpredictably) may be perceived as a threat, but organisms may be unable to predict their occurrence, since it would require refined cognitive abilities. For a species or population to adapt to an event, the event must thus occur with sufficient frequency and for a sufficiently long period of time.

What an animal perceives as a stochastic process depends on the stochasticity of the process relative to the animal's size, current age (or average lifespan), and adaptability. Generally, small, short-lived, or young organisms will tend to be more sensitive to small-scale (spatial) or short-term (temporal) changes [@southwood_habitat_1977]. Smaller organisms (e.g., mice) are more likely to be be severely impacted by a stochastic event than larger ones (e.g. elephants), since larger organisms can have bigger energy reserves, can move longer distances over short periods of time, and tend to have longer lifespans, generation times, and developmental periods, which allow them to develop or memory about the frequency and severity of such events [@foley_severe_2008; @polansky_elucidating_2015]. However, the short generation time and high fertility of smaller *r-limited* species [@ref] can allow them to develop traits that increase the chances of survival following an extreme event. Additionally, the effects of size and lifespan on sensitivity are likely nonlinear and correlated, since smaller animals tend to have shorter lives (and vice-versa), and small animals also tend to have lower metabolic rates, which often limit their movement speed, home ranges, and how the animals interact with their ecosystem [@brown_toward_2004]. Thus, processes will have stronger impacts on smaller animals than on bigger ones: The grazing pattern of a bison (*Bison bison*) drastically alters the habitat of most crawling insects, but other grazing mammals would not pay attention to changes in grass length at the same spatial or temporal resolution. Similarly, the timing and quantity of yearly snowfall would be a somewhat predictable and expected event for most adult moose (*Alces alces*), but it may be a shock for many adult zooplankton or a new-born wolf (*Canis lupus*). Thus, what one animal may perceive as a single stochastic event (or cycle) may be considered as a series of short and highly stochastic events by another animal.

Figure \@ref(fig:stochasticity-timescale-figure) illustrates the perceived resource availability mean and variance by animals with four different levels of adaptability and how they may predict the mean and variance to change in the future (after the vertical grey line). In the extreme (and likely fictitious) case where an animal does not adapt to the environment (dark blue), it cannot react to or predict changes in mean resource abundance, and thus the perceived variance is inflated whenever the resource abundance does not match the overall mean. Environments appear highly unpredictable to such animals. Animals which can only perceive simple, linear changes in mean resource abundance (orange) perform better as long as resources continue to change linearly in the same direction (i.e. increasing or decreasing). However, they may be surprised when the trend's direction changes, as indicated by the rapid increase in variance in the top rows of figure \@ref(fig:stochasticity-timescale-figure)b. Animals which are able to adapt smoothly (light blue) can predict changes in mean without a significant bias in estimated variance, as long as the process is not highly stochastic (unsurprisingly, see the bottom rows of figure \@ref(fig:stochasticity-timescale-figure)). Finally, animals which adapt rapidly to changing environments may be most able to take advantage of frequent environmental changes, but they may be unable to produce reasonable predictions based on memory [*sensu* @abrahms_memory_2019]. Instead, they depend on constant information and only predict on the most recent information (as indicated by the deviations from the data when predicting into the future).

```

While the effects of resource abundance on animal's spatial needs have been studied extensively [e.g., @lucherini_habitat_1996; @nilsen_can_2005; @bengsen_feral_2016; @dickie_resource_nodate in press], the effects of environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity, including those around resource abundance, have not been given as much consideration [but see @lucherini_habitat_1996; @rizzuto_forage_2021]. Environmental stochasticity has been of interest to biologists for multiple decades [e.g., @bell_spatial_1993], but until recently changes in variance have been hard to quantify because they require large amounts of data to produce reasonably precise and accurate estimates, especially if the variance varies over time or space.

The recent shift to more quantitative statistical methods in environmental biology has pushed scientists to begin thinking more critically about data analysis. However, many still operate using methods and frameworks which were necessary with small datasets, but likely become problematic with an abundance of data. For instance, the widespread frequentist approach of hypothesis testing with a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$ may often be misleading, because the significance of an effect depends on its standard error, which is a function of its sample size, since larger samples will offer a more precise and accurate measurement of the true mean. Similarly, the question of how much data is needed to detect a significant trend [@gray_how_2018] may seem important to some, but I suggest we pay less attention to whether an event or trend is statistically significant over a period of time based on the dichotomy of significance based on an arbitrary significance level. Since statistical significance does not only depend on effect size but also sample size (including measurement frequency), high-frequency data is likely to produce statistically significant effects, even in the event of a false positive. Instead, we should focus primarily on whether a change has an important impact on the fitness of the animal(s) of interest [@zuur_mixed_2009].

### The temporal scale of stochastic events

An animal's ability to alter its behavior (including its movement) in response to environmental conditions is essential in stochastic or changing landscapes. Whether the changes be due to highly variable but (potentially) predictable changes such as the seasons and the weather, or whether they be due to more stochastic events [e.g., natural events such as fires or floods, but also anthropogenic events like oil spills; see @matkin_ongoing_2008], an animal's ability to adapt increases its odds of survival. Generally, temporal variation is more likely to promote plasticity over diversity, since adaptability will likely offer better odds of survival than temporally static diversity in a population or species [@bell_spatial_1993]. @rickbeil_plasticity_2019 showed that the yearly migration of elk (*Cervus canadensis*) depends on variable environmental events and cues such as available forage biomass, hunting pressure, snow fall, and snow melt. Birds have also shown to change their their migration as the climate changes, including large-scale, trans-Saharian migrants [@jonzen_rapid_2006]. And while genetic diversity and polymorphisms also increase the odds of survival for a species [@ref], this project will focus strictly on animal behavior.

In an environment that changes over time, organisms which depend on mutable cycles such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and resource availability are more likely to respond to environmental changes than organisms which depend purely on deterministic cycles (e.g., photoperiod). While this thesis focuses on the movement and spatial use of animals, the adaptability (or lack thereof) of non-animal organisms is also crucial. The ability of most animals to rely on visual cues and move accordingly greatly increases their adaptability and plasticity, particularly for those animals that are able to move large distances over short periods of time (e.g., flying birds and large vertebrates). Although this project will focus on vertebrate animals, such changes are important to consider because the ability of a specialist or obligate symbiont to shift its home range or adapt will likely depend strongly on its associate's ability to move or adapt, too.

#### Temporal changes in home range

The length of an animal's lifespan and the size of their space use can determine how we classify their movement. However, we should minimize the bias which may arise from considering an animal's temporal and spatial scales relative to our perception of time and space. A fruit fly that lives in a building and has a lifespan of a few days is more likely to seem range-resident to us because the space it lived in is relatively small and familiar to us, but if the animal is a large mammal moving across habitats, we may tend to consider the animal a nomad. In this project, I will use a definition of home range similar to that of @burt_territoriality_1943 (i.e., the area used by an animal to satisfy its essential needs) while viewing it as a continuous-time stochastic process: Since both an animal's needs and their habitat may change over time, I will consider an animal to be range resident if it inhabits a region with a stable centroid during the period of observation. While I would still consider an animal range-resident if it moved its centroid suddenly (rather than with a slow drift), the models implemented in the `ctmm` [@fleming_ctmm_2021] package for `R` [@r_core_team_r_2021] assume the centroid is stable, so I would not be able to estimate two separate home ranges. Instead, I would have to consider each region as temporary sections of the overall range. If the animal lives in a group, tracking other members of the group may help understand whether the animal shifted its home range or is not range-resident.

### The spatial scale of stochastic events

To measure the spatial stochasticity of an ecosystem, it is necessary to first define extent of the ecosystem of interest. A lake may seem like a simple and self-contained space to define, but it is often not as simple as deciding the lake's boundaries using a map or satellite pictures. Should one include the shores of the lake? And if so, which region do we consider the lake's shores? Are they the area of land which are currently covered by water, including the sections hit daily by waves, or should we also include the parts of land which are currently not wet but are covered during seasons with more rain? One could base their definition on the species of interest, since coastal areas are not frequented by large fish, but they would likely include them in the ecosystem if they are studying benthic litoral species. Thus, how one measures stochasticity should also depend on which organisms are of most interest.

Since species in a heterogeneous landscape can modify their behavior and move to more favorable locations, spatial variation will favor movement and behavioral adaptations faster than temporal variation will [@bell_spatial_1993].

Transition regions are often have the highest heterogeneity, but, similarly to temporal stochasticity, measures and perceptions of spatial heterogeneity depend on the scale at which they are being considered. The repetitive and cyclical motion of waves may not concern most vertebrates that live along the coast, but it is much more turbulent and chaotic for smaller organisms, such as crustaceans or diatoms. Therefore, the scale at which we consider spatial stochasticity should depend on the size of the organisms of interest as well as the size of their habitat or home range.

Although @bell_spatial_1993 couldn't find a scale at which variance stopped increasing, it seems reasonable to assume that variance cannot increase infinitely. The variance of a finite system (e.g., a lake or a well-defined habitat), should reach a finite maximum somewhere between our smallest scale of interest and the scale of the entire system, even if the maximum is reached when the entire system is considered. This does not imply that a somewhat larger system that contains the first one (e.g. the lake and its coasts) will have the same variance. Variance between lake and coast is high because they are different types of habitats, and the area where they meet (the coast) is potentially even more variable because the mixture of the two creates a third habitat for litoral benthic animals which is subject to high stochasticity due to waves and changing water levels.

The same idea would likely also apply for larger-scale systems, such as continents or a planet. And while stochasticity of a system may also vary over time, it is not reasonable to expect it to increase monotonically through time because that would imply it has been increasing monotonically until the current moment. Still, stochasticity does vary over time, and its estimation depends on the data available, so it may be useful to view it as a random variable with an estimated, conditional posterior distribution through a Bayesian framework [@bolstad_introduction_2017].

<!-- The $\gamma$-variance between spatiotemporal points at a given (spatiotemporal, multidimensional) lag $\vec h$ is calculated as $$\gamma(\vec h) = \frac 12 \mathbb E\left[Z(\vec x + \vec h) - Z(\vec x) \right]^2 = \frac 12 Var\left[Z(\vec x + \vec h) - Z(\vec x) \right]$$ [@bachmaier_variogram_2011]. The $\frac 12$ is because we don't need to repeat each pair (e.g., $V((a, b), (b, a)) = 2 V((a, b))$). View $\gamma(\vec h)$ as a function of $\vec h$ rather than a fixed value. -->

### Urban landscapes and habitat structure

Human activity often fundamentally alters the structure of environments by spatially homogenizing them and imposing temporally heterogeneous and potentially stochastic cycles (e.g., mining, clear-cutting, road traffic, and weekly work schedules). The perception of spatial heterogeneity and cycles in anthropogenic areas varies between species: scavenger animals such as ravens (*Corvus corax*) and raccoons (*Procyon lotor*) often learn to recognize areas that can provide food, such as restaurants or large disposal bins, but other animals may not be able to distinguish between different urban areas. Certain animals have learned to depend on and take advantage of human activity, such as crows who place nuts strategically so that cars will crack them open for them to eat [@nihei_when_2002].
