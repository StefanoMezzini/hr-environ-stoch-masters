# Open and transparent science: Code and data availability {#os}

All code and figures used in this project are available at the GitHub repository located at [https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/hr-environ-stoch-masters](https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/hr-environ-stoch-masters). The repository currently does not include the animal movement data that will be used, which is available on Movebank and will be linked in future R scripts in the repository. The tapir movement data used for figure \@ref(fig:tapir-hr) is available in the `data` folder at [https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/tapirs](https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/tapirs).

All scripts include comments to help people replicate the analysis, but they do assume some basic knowledge of `R` (including referring to help files and vignettes). Comments and requests regarding the project can be placed in the repository as issues.
