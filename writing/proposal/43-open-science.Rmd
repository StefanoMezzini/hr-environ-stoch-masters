# Open and transparent science: Code and data availability {#os}

All code and figures used in this project are available at the GitHub repository located at [https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/hr-environ-stoch-phd](https://github.com/StefanoMezzini/hr-environ-stoch-phd) and related repositories (linked in the former's main README file). The repositories will not include any publicly available data, unless the data was substantially wrangled or cleaned.

All scripts will include comments to help people replicate the analysis, but they will assume some basic knowledge of `R` (including referring to help files and vignettes). Comments and requests regarding the project can be placed in the repositories as issues, or sent directly to my email address.
