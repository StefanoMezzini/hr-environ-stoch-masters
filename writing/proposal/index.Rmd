# abstract <- "The ability to move allows motile organisms to access more resources and decrease the risk of mortality or injury from various threats, including predation, competition, and extreme events such as floods and fires. Many animals depend on movement to achieve an energetic balance, survive, and reproduce. Animals' spatial needs depend on a multitude of factors, including resource abundance, competitive pressure, predation, weather, and climate. The effects of many of these factors have been studied extensively, but the effects of resource stochasticity remain largely understudied. This thesis aims to quantify how resource abundance and stochasticity affect animals' spatial needs using theoretical arguments, computational simulations, and a large animal movement dataset of over 3000 individuals from more than 85 globally-distributed species. To this end, this thesis will produce a new global measure of resource variance which will be used to quantify the effect of environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity on animals' spatial needs while accounting for spatiotemporal trends and correlations within populations and species. The animals' movement will be modeled using continuous-time stochastic movement models. The effects of environmental variance on animal's spatial needs will be estimated using hierarchical generalized additive models that account for common trends between taxonomic groups and populations. The work will be carried out within a framework that recognizes the value of different forms of knowledge, including Traditional Indigenous Knowledge, and it will incorporate Traditional Indigenous Knowledge when possible. Overall, I expect spatial needs to be lower in areas with higher resource abundance and lower environmental variance. However, I also expect the effects of resource abundance and environmental variance to depend on the species and ecosystems of interest. Thus, the average trends between species may not be representative of individual populations and species."

It will begin by proposing new, foundational hypotheses of how resource abundance and stochasticity affect animals' spatial needs, and it will support such hypotheses using quantitative simulations. Next, it will quantify resource abundance and stochasticity worldwide during the last five decades using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a location-scale hierarchical generalized additive model. It will then test the again hypotheses using tracking data from over 3000 mammals across more than 85 globally-distributed species.

# Foreword: Recognizing Traditional Indigenous Knowledge {-}

\noindent The lands managed and protected by Indigenous Peoples are often markedly different from those inhabited by urban societies or conserved by Western organizations. While acknowledging that there is great diversity between Indigenous Peoples (as well as other colonized Peoples), it is important to recognize that many different Peoples hold great knowledge on how to safeguard habitats, protect biodiversity, and live sustainably as an integral part of Nature [@schuster_vertebrate_2019], and that many have been doing so for millennia [@bennett_evidence_2021]. While Indigenous leaders, representatives, and Knowledge keepers have recently taken a more active role in conservation-related decision-making, their perspective is often still not valued [@lamb_braiding_2023]. Instead, many Western institutions continue to dismiss, ignore, and contradict the ancestral and traditional Knowledge of Indigenous and and other colonized Peoples [@smith_decolonizing_2021; @kimmerer_braiding_2020]. Consequently, the development of Western science is frequently assumed to clash with the (often sacred) Knowledge many colonized Peoples hold. Western science is often viewed as more objective, more methodical, and more unbiased than Traditional Knowledge, and as such Western institutions and people often consider it to be superior to Indigenous Knowledge [@smith_decolonizing_2021]. However, the refusal to recognize traditional Knowledge and cooperate with non-Western institutions often results in a loss of time, resources, and funds for the Western institutions as well as severe (and potentially irreparable) damage to the Land and to those who inhabit the It [@smith_decolonizing_2021]. The development of Western science at the exclusion of Indigenous Peoples perpetuates colonialism and brings harm all parties involved, and reinforces "research" as the 'dirtiest word' for many Indigenous Peoples [see page 1 of @smith_decolonizing_2021]. <!--The sharing, development, recognition, and ownership (or lack thereof) of knowledge (and Sacred Knowledge) are core aspects of imperialism [@smith_decolonizing_2021, p. xii].-->

The concept of *two-eyed seeing* refers to an approach to knowledge and growth that braids Indigenous Knowledge and science together with Western science [@kutz_two-eyed_2019; @kimmerer_braiding_2020]. Since Traditional Indigenous Knowledge tends to be qualitative, while biological sciences tend to be quantitative, connecting the two is not always simple [@bowles_threepronged_2021]. Although this project does not focus on Indigenous Knowledge or Data, I intend to carryout the work with an anti-imperial and anti-colonial sentiment. I recognize my ignorance in the field in the hopes of receiving valuable critiques, direction, and suggestions. During the project, I intend connecting with local Indigenous groups and Nations to offer help, develop relationshipts, and exchange knowledge (while recognizing that I do not have the right to all knowledge and that many forms and sources of Knowledge are sacred and private).
