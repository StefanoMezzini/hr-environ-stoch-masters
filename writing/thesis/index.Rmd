I would like to thank Dr. Noonan for offering me the opportunity to pursue a Master's degree with such an interesting project with cutting-edge statistical methods for movement ecology. I have already learned a lot and I expect I will learn much more.

I would like to thank Dr. Ford and Dr. Pither for agreeing to be on my committee. Your feedback and mentorship will help me ensure this project is relevant and directly applicable to current issues regarding conservation and biogeography.

I would like to thank Sandra Fox for providing me with resources to ensure my perspective and work are inclusive and supportive of different ways of knowing, including Indigenous Knowledge, and that my attitude remains anti-colonial and anti-imperial.
