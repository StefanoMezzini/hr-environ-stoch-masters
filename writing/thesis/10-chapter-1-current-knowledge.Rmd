## Home ranges as proxies for animals' needs

The ability to move allows most animals to adapt rapidly and continuously to heterogeneous and changing environments. Animals may move to search for resources (e.g., as food, nutrients, water, heat, a new den or nesting spot), a mate, or a new group. Movement also allows animals to escape predation or dangerous competition, and it allows them to defend resources and territory, too. Thus, we can estimate changes in animals' movement and space use as a proxy for many needs, rather than measuring changes in the various individual needs [@ref].

The concept of a home range (HR) is often used to indicate the space an animal requires to satisfy its essential needs during a period of time [@burt_territoriality_1943]. Such needs include energetic needs and reproductive needs (which are not limited to finding a mate, since offspring require energy a safe location to develop in, too), but exploratory movement outside the core HR are generally not accounted for. However, for an animal to have what we may consider a HR, the animal must remain in a stable "home" area for long periods of time. That is, the animal must be range-resident and the HR must have a stable centroid. Stable centroids may be concrete locations such as an eagle's nest, a bear's den, or a bee's hive, or they may be abstract points such as the center of a coyote’s hunting grounds or the center of a deer’s foraging grounds.

While the HR may change over time (e.g., following a forest fire or a flood), it should remain be stable during the period of observation. Ideally, properties of the HR (e.g., range size and crossing time) are representative of any new HR the animal will move to if the current one becomes inhospitable. Thus, animals with an unstable centroid would not be appropriate for HR analysis. Nomadic or migrating animals [e.g., @nandintsetseg_variability_2019] are thus generally not considered range resident, and tracking periods should be long enough to provide a representative sample of the animal's spatial needs.

In the case of a species or population where spatial needs change over the animals' lifetimes [e.g., @ref], one may define HR as a function of the animal's life stages (with distinct discrete HRs) or as a function of age (so HR changes smoothly). In either case, the accuracy of the estimate will depend strongly on the length of the observation period as well as the measurement frequency. Data from a portion of an animal's life may be sufficient if it is representative the animal's movement or if inference is limited to the period(s) for which data is available (figure \@ref(fig:hr-and-lifespan)).

```{r hr-and-lifespan, fig.cap="Simulated movement of an individual over their life. Samples from different periods of the animal's life may result in different conclusions, such as slow nomadism (a) or range residency (b), but neither sample is representative of the space the animal used over its entire life (c).", out.width='100%'}

```

There are many factors which may affect animal's spatial requirements and how they use their HR. Resource abundance is often assumed to be inversely proportional to HR size (or some function of it), such that regions with higher abundance correspond to smaller spatial needs. However, the effect of many other factors likely depends on how an animal responds to them. For instance, competition may push individuals to explore other areas and expand their HR, but strong and consistent competition may also prevent them from doing so. Similarly, predation may force animals to move more frequently to escape predators, or it may prevent them from venturing too far from the safety of their den (the HR's centroid) too often. Fragmentation and patch heterogeneity may cause animals to explore more patches if some are of low value, but high diversity may also decrease HR size [@lucherini_habitat_1996]. Similarly, patch connectivity and ease of movement may favor exploration and a wider HR [@dickie_resource_nodate in press], or they may decrease the animal's energetic needs and the HR with it.

protective/defensive adaptations peaks at intermediate levels of competitor density/spatial resource density/spatiotemporal clumping. At low competition, there's no need for defense and the cost (e.g., energetic) and risk (e.g., wounds) outweigh the benefit, while at high values the cost and risk become too high and they outweigh the benefit [@grant_whether_1993].

See *The effects of phenological mismatches on demography*.

@rickbeil_plasticity_2019:
- Many species use seasonal migration to track emerging resources (Fryxell, Greever, & Sinclair, 1988), reduce predation risk (Hebblewhite & Merrill, 2009), or avoid disease and parasites (Altizer, Bartel, & Han, 2011).
- Migrations to track resources are often timed to coincide with peak plant and insect emergence (Aikens et al., 2017; Jonzén et al., 2006; Merkle et al., 2016)
- there is growing evidence that some [bird] populations are adjusting their behavior, suggesting that migration, specifically migration timing, may be more plastic than previously expected (Jonzén, Hedenstrom, & Lundberg, 2007; Jonzén et al., 2006; Lameris et al., 2018) and highlighting a potential measure of resilience in the face of climate change
- Elk departed earlier from highly-productive areas? This goes against the idea that animals move as a consequence of need. But maybe the elk simply left when they had enough stored energy to face the migration. Maybe elk migration is triggered when they have sufficient energy (if the weather is still not too harsh).
- Elk left early when exposed to hunting more

The effects of resource abundance on animals' spatial needs have been studied by many in the last century. Multiple general hypotheses have been postulated based on (relatively) small-scale empirical studies [e.g., @burt_territoriality_1943; @southwood_habitat_1977; @lindstedt_seasonality_1985; @grant_whether_1993; @lucherini_habitat_1996; @nilsen_can_2005; @bengsen_feral_2016], and supported (or questioned) by more recent work with larger, higher-resolution datasets [e.g., @jonzen_rapid_2006; @wolkovich_warming_2012; @falcon-cortes_hierarchical_2021; @dickie_resource_nodate in press] and simulations [@blackwell_heterogeneity_2007]. Recently, the amount of movement data which can be modeled at once has increased due to improvements in the quality and affordability of tracking equipment [@rutz_new_2009], together with growing propensity (and requirements) to share data openly on various open data platforms such as Movebank [@kranstauber_movebank_2011; @kays_movebank_2022; but see @roche_public_2015], as well as the development of high-level modeling software [e.g., @r_core_team_r_2021; @wood_generalized_2017; @burkner_brms_2017; @burkner_advanced_2018].

It is understood that an animal's spatial use strongly depends on the amount of resources and energy the animal can obtain from their habitat, but estimates are often restricted to single populations or at most single species. To my knowledge, there are currently no large-scale estimations of vertebrate (or mammalian) space use as a function of resource availability. Additionally, little attention is often given to the stochasticity of resource availability or, more generally, habitat heterogeneity and stochasticity [but see @lucherini_habitat_1996; @nilsen_can_2005; @rizzuto_forage_2021]. This project aims to quantify the effects of resource abundance and environmental stochasticity on animal space use using statistical models which are based on continuous-time stochastic processes and are insensitive to sampling frequency and spatiotemporal or taxonomic autocorrelation in the data. We hope findings from this project will inform us on how stochasticity has shaped the ecology and evolution of terrestrial mammals and how terrestrial mammals are currently adapting to heterogeneous and changing environments.

## Effects of resource availability and productivity on spatial needs

Environmental productivity is tightly linked to the amount of space that animals need to cover to obtain the resources they needed to survive and reproduce [@lucherini_habitat_1996; @relyea_home_2000]. While resource availability is often considered in conservation decision-making [@refs], an environment's heterogeneity (i.e., diversity), stochasticity (i.e., unpredictability), and how the two change over time are rarely accounted for. In addition, environmental stochasticity, including extreme events, can reduce a landscape's energetic balance [@chevin_adaptation_2010], which, in turn, decreases animals' fitness. Therefore, I expect animals living in unpredictable environments to require more space than those in stable environments. Although this hypothesis is supported by a few recent studies [@morellet_seasonality_2013; @nandintsetseg_variability_2019; @riotte-lambert_environmental_2020], many of them are limited in their analytical depth and geographic and taxonomic scales, so the extent to which these preliminary findings can be generalized is still very limited. There thus remains a need for developing a more complete understanding of how animals' spatial needs change with environmental stochasticity. These stresses are compounded by climate change, which exposes species to increasingly common stochastic events [@ipcc_global_2018; @noonan_situ_2018]. Furthermore, anthropogenic structures reduce the habitat available to terrestrial species [@wilson_habitat_2016], who struggle to move in fragmented [@fahrig_non-optimal_2007], human-dominated landscapes [@tucker_moving_2018]. As the impacts of habitat loss and climate change will worsen in the future [@ipcc_global_2018; @hansen_high-resolution_2013], it is imperative that we better understand spatial requirements of taxa to protect wildlife existence and biodiversity. Environmental safeguarding is also essential for Reconciliation with Indigenous People in Canada [@truth_and_reconciliation_commission_of_canada_honouring_2015].

Animals' needs vary greatly between taxonomic groups, but some needs are essential for most species for survival and reproduction, such as energetic needs [e.g., food, water; see @ref], habitat needs [e.g., dens, trees, tall grass, breeding grounds, protection from predators and competitors; see @refs], and maintaining a thermoregulatory balance. The size of a home range (defined as the area used by an animal to satisfy its essential needs, such as gathering food and resources, mating, and raising offspring), is hypothesized to be proportional to resource abundance [@burt_territoriality_1943], such that spatial needs increase when resources are low, but the relationship is likely not monotonic nor linear, since larger home ranges can result in higher rates of competition and are harder to defend [@grant_whether_1993; @jetz_scaling_2004]. Home range size is also affected by resource (or patch) connectivity, since well-connected habitats can decrease the energetic cost of movement and increase resource exploitation rates [@dickie_resource_nodate in press], although the effect human modifications have on animal movement may depend on environmental harshness [@dawe_influence_2014]. However, not all animals take advantage of linear features or higher predictability in human-altered habitats. @noonan_roads_2021 found that giant anteaters (*Myrmecophaga tridactyla*) in Brazil did not use roads to reduce movement costs or increase movement speed. Instead, roads increased anteater mortality because the animals were attracted to the high-quality foraging found on roadside habitat. Similarly, @medici_movement_nodate (in press) found that the movement of tapirs (*Tapirus terrestris*) was unaffected by anthropogenic activity or habitat type.

## Effects of environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity on spatial needs

The favorableness of a patch or habitat often depends on a variety of factors, including resource availability, competitive pressure, and predation risk. Let $R$ indicate the amount of *resources* in a particular patch, and let $S$ be the random variable indicating whether or not a patch visit is *successful*. For simplicity, we can let $S$ follow a Bernoulli distribution with probability of success $p$ (which we can write as $S \sim Ber(p)$). Next, let $U = R \cdot S$ indicate the resources an animal can *use* during a visit. Following this simple model, a patch visit can result in two possible outcomes: if the visit is successful ($S = 1$), an animal can use the entirety of the resource ($U = R \cdot 1 = R$), but if it is unsuccessful ($S = 0$) the animal is unable to access any of the resource ($U = R \cdot 0 = 0$).

Let's start by considering the simplistic (and unlikely) scenario where patches are fully predictable and free of disturbance and competition, such that the animal can access the patches' resources during any visit, i.e., $p = P(S = 1) = 1$. In heterogeneous regions with no stochasticity (figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-constant)a-b), the favorableness of a location will depend strongly on $R$, so regions with higher $R$ should be preferred (figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-constant)c). Since all patch visits in fully predictable regions are successful, animals can expect $U$ to be equal to $R$, since $U = R \cdot S = R \cdot 1 = R$ (figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-constant)d), which implies that $\mathbb E(U) = \mathbb E(R \, S) = \mathbb E(R)$. Since $U = R$, animals can choose their home ranges based on $R$ without having to account for any spatiotemporal stochasticity. Therefore, animals in such regions are likely to maximize fitness and minimize movement costs by spending large amounts of time in highly productive regions, with occasional exploratory movements to different patches. This model is quite simplistic, but its simplicity makes it easy to fit and conceptualize. While it is unlikely for a region to be fully predictable, this model may provide acceptable results when environmental variance is low and has little effect on animal fitness, such as is areas where the variation in $U$, $\mathbb V(U)$, is low relative to its expected value, $\mathbb E(U)$, such that the costs of moving to another favorable area are low or the chances of encountering prey are high. Mathematically, we can say that this simple model may be acceptable when the coefficient of variation, $\sqrt{\mathbb V(R)} / \mathbb E(R)$, is low. Additionally, this model may be the only option when data availability is too low to produce appreciable measures of stochasticity or there is no way to estimate it.

```{r bernoulli-constant, out.width='100%', fig.cap="Fictitious example of variation in resource abundance in a heterogenous but fully predictable environment. (a.) Complete predictability results in success (black dots) during each foraging attempt (white dots). (b.) Although the environment is heterogenous, there is no stochsticity because it is fully predictable. (c.) Since an animal living in such an environment can expect each foraging attemp to be successful, it will likely rely more on areas with high density of resources."}
knitr::include_graphics('../../figures/bernoulli-constant-p.png')
```

In areas where animals are not guaranteed that the resources they find during one visit will be there the next time (figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-changing)a), stochasticity will have an appreciable effect on the location's favourableness. Patches with low or high $p$ will be most predictable, since successes can be expected to be very rare (if $p \approx 0$) or very common (if $p \approx 1$). In contrast, patches will be most stochastic when the probabilities of success and failure are approximately the same (i.e., $p \approx 1 - p \implies p \approx 0.5$, see figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-changing)b). In stochastic habitats, $\mathbb E(U)$ will depend on $\mathbb E(S)$ as well as $\mathbb E(R)$, since $S$ is no longer constant (figure \@ref(fig:bernoulli-changing)c). Now, expected usable resources become $\mathbb E(U) = \mathbb E(R \, S)$, or $\mathbb E(U) = \mathbb E(R) \, \mathbb E(S)$ if $R$ and $S$ are independent. This model can be applied to all mobile animals, including herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. In the case of herbivores, $p$ may indicate the chance of finding good forage, which may be absent if regeneration times are long, if competitors have already exhausted the resource, or following a fire. For carnivores, $p$ may indicate the chance of feeding on prey, which may depend on encountering and killing some first. However, since $R$ is not limited to energetic resources, $p$ may also indicate the chance of finding water or also a suitable location for a den or nest.

The probability of success (black dots) during a foraging attempt (white dot) can vary between patches due to various reasons, including differences in competition, predation, and resource-specific trends. (b.) Patches where the probability of success is very low (e.g., a, b) or very high (e.g., j, k) are highly predictable because animals can expect very poor or very good resource availability, respectively. In contrast, patches where the probability of success is near 0.5 (e.g., e, f, g) are higly stochastic because failure and success are approximately equally as likely. (c.) An animal living in such an environment cannot always expect each foraging attemp to be successful. When possible, animals are likely to rely mostly on predictable, resource-rich areas (top right). Alternatively, they may prefer predictable but resouce-poor areas (top left) or specialize for high-risk, high-reward areas (bottom right)."}

## Interaction effects of resource availability and stochasticity

In the previous section, I mentioned that a model which does not account for environmental variance may be acceptable when $\sqrt{\mathbb V(R)} / \mathbb E(R)$ is low, as in the case of a habitat with high $R$ and $p \approx 1$. However, since maximum resource abundance is constrained by environmental stochasticity [@chevin_adaptation_2010] and resources can be depleted or rendered inaccessible by other individuals, $\mathbb E(R)$ does not provide a sufficiently complete picture of resource availability in an environment. Thus, the effect of $\mathbb V(R)$ should be included when possible, even when $p \approx 1$ or $p \approx 0$. <!--Spatiotemporally constant and homogeneous regions will allow animals to have a small and dependable home range, while stochastic regions will force animals to have higher spatial needs and possibly store resources for periods of scarcity. Similarly, heterogeneous environments, such as habitats with a high variety of patches, may force animals to move between patches if they cannot depend on a single one. Conversely, if some patches are sufficient and highly valuable, animals may adopt strong defensive behaviors towards the patch [@grant_whether_1993]. Thus, some measure of $\mathbb V(R)$ is needed to understand how stochasticity may affect spatial requirements.-->

Let $H$ indicate the size of an animal's HR. (We can consider specific utilization quantiles of the HR, such as the core HR ($H_{50\%}$) or the 95% HR ($H_{95\%}$), but for simplicity I will refer to the entirety of the HR with $H$). As explained above, $H$ will be higher in regions with lower $\mathbb E(R)$ and higher $\mathbb V(R)$. Figure \@ref(fig:5-5-panel) presents various scenarios with different trends in $\mathbb E(R)$ and $\mathbb V(R)$

Figure \@ref(fig:5-5-sims) demonstrates how such trends can affect $\mathbb E(V)$ and the 95% home range estimate (which is a function of $\mathbb E(V)$ and $\mathbb V(V)$).

```{r 5-5-panel, fig.cap="Simulated resource availability with constant, linearly increasing, cyclical, drifting, and erratic means or variances. The red lines are the means estimated by a Generalized Additive Model fit by the $\\texttt{ggplot2::geom\\_smooth()}$ function, while the shaded areas are the range of $\\pm$ 2 true (i.e, not estimated) standard deviations around the estimated mean.", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../../figures/mean-variance-5-by-5.png')
```

***expand***

The smoothed conditional means show that the amount of detail in our estimates depends directly on our data resolution (which is why some red lines don't look similar to the orange mean ones, especially for the stochastic mean). This also adds a new consideration, because the change in the mean is not the same as the variance in the data, but we cannot distinguish the two (easily).

```{r 5-5-sims, fig.cap="Simulated spatial requirements for animals living in habitats where resource availability vary with constant, linearly increasing, cyclical, drifting, or erratic means and variances. The thick line indicates the mean spatial requirement needed for survival, while the thin line indicates the 95\\% quantile. The thick line can also be interpreted as the animal's core home range, while thin line can be interpreted as the requirements needed for a 95\\% chance of survival, which would be similar to the animals' 95\\% home range. Changes in $\\mathbb V(R)$ have greater impacts when $\\mathbb E(R)$ or $\\mathbb V(R)$ are low.", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('../../figures/mean-variance-5-by-5-sims.png')
```

Changes in variance have greater effects in highly predictable areas because changing variance from near 0 to any number is multiplicatively much larger than increasing an already large variance.

Note that although the variance in available energy, $\\mathbb V(E)$, is related to the variance in patch visits, the two are not the same. More variable habitats will result in larger spatial requirements, but the relationship is not linear, since habitats with higher mean available energy result in lower spatial requirements.

Although some of these scenarios may seem overly simplistic 

Also, a highly stochastic variance will be perceived (and estimated) as a smoothly-changing variance unless we have very high amounts of data.

Apply mean VS variance 5x5 figure to HR size or location:

* there are conditions where remaining in a particular habitat becomes unsustainable and migrations or range shifts are required for survival,
* cyclical changes in $\mathbb E(R)$ and $\mathbb V(R)$ may occur in urban environments [@peron_periodic_2017] or as temperature and precipitation change between seasons [@geremia_migrating_2019]. 
* **drifting** could be because of a highly complex ecosystem with many unpredictable agents (e.g., tropical areas with high density of insects like locusts?)
* **erratic** could be because of sudden events (e.g., fires, human activity)

## Movement types

### Range residency


### Seasonal migration


### Nomadism

predation is more stochastic than herbibory; predators need to match more cycles, depend on less individuals -> more variable food

@teitelbaum_beyond_2019:
- **Nomadic movement**: with irregular timing and/or direction, producing both within-year and between-year variability in location and movement patterns
- **Nomadic movement** is not the same as **migration**, because migration is predictable and cyclical while nomadism is random in time and space
- "Data from recent developments in animal tracking technology (e.g., longer-lasting and lighter GPS devices) show that species previously considered migrants or range residents can show irregular, often long-distance, movement patterns (flexible foraging movements of leatherback turtles across the north atlantic ocean, To migrate, stay put, or wander Varied movement strategies in bald eagles, Big data analyses reveal patterns and drivers of the movements of southern elephant seals)"

### Edge dynamics

## Simulations

Include:

* effects of animal mass,
* resistance to/ease of movement (e.g., wolves and clear-cut gas lines)
* "state-space model" with 2 spaces: within a patch (slow-moving) and between patches (faster movement)

See `R` packages for meta-community simulations

## Objectives

This project aims to quantify how animal's movement and use of space are affected by the abundance of resources (e.g., food, water, breeding grounds) and environmental stochasticity. This work has four key objectives: (i) estimating individuals' spatial requirements in a way which is insensitive to variation in sampling protocols and data quality; (ii) quantifying environmental stochasticity and its effects; (iii) estimating between-species trends using models that are robust to commonly-found issues (e.g., correlations within species); and (iv) understanding how Traditional Indigenous Knowledge can be integrated into large-scale ecological research and conservation planning within a framework that acknowledges both Traditional Indigenous Knowledge and Western science [@kutz_two-eyed_2019]. In Chapter 2, I will produce a global raster of a new environmental stochasticity index, and new quantitative methods for animal movement. Findings will inform design of protected areas and assist in conserving Canada's wildlife, particularly in light of Canada's pledge to protect 30% of its landmass and oceans by 2030 [@ryan_patrick_jones_pm_2021], although only 13% of Canada’s area is currently protected [@government_of_canada_canadian_2021]. Local Indigenous groups will be included in the research process, in the hope of forming long-lasting co-operative relationships.

In Chapter 3, I will use simulation studies and an unprecedented and conservation-relevant animal tracking dataset (>1500 animals, 77 globally-distributed species) to provide the most detailed investigation into how animal spatial needs change with environmental stochasticity to date.

<!-- To achieve these aims: (i) I will use continuous-time models [@johnson_continuous-time_2008] that do not depend on sampling frequency. Such models will allow me to use the entirety of the data rather than aggregated data (e.g., daily averages), as aggregated data contain less information on sample variance and can lead to biased estimates. (ii) I will produce a global, time-varying raster of environmental stochasticity which accounts for productivity [@nilsen_can_2005], weather, and climate (e.g., precipitation and temperature), as well as the frequency of extreme events (e.g., heat domes, flooding, forest fires). I will then use the raster to estimate the effect of stochasticity on home range sizes. (iii) I will use a hierarchical approach [@pedersen_hierarchical_2019] to estimate common trends and variances within and between populations, species, and data collection methods. (iv) I will collaborate closely with with various Indigenous groups and include any Traditional Knowledge and practices they wish to include in my project. The research will be published in open-access journals and all code will be publicly available. -->
