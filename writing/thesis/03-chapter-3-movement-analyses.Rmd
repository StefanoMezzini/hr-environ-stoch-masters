# Chapter 3: Movement analyses

## Movement simulations

- Inform priors and simulation distributions using Indigenous Traditional Knowledge

## Stochasticity map

- currently there's no raster of stochasticity => paper / product
- PCA on main drivers/causes of stochasticity

## Movement analysis

- add HFI to analysis (but it's temporally static)
- look at HPAMs?
