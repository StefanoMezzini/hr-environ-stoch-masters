- good ending with practical application

- concentrate on opening:
	- opening is weak and short
	- shorten parts on biological formulae, focus on scenarios
	- use an anecdote or a stat to hook people

- add ~20s of intro (examples of caribou in different environments)

- define unpredictability with a quote to captivate
- unpredictability is an interesting term

- check rules for slides (is title required or not?)

- use free images for the slide:
	- https://pixabay.com/
	- https://unsplash.com/ can see licences and what's allowed

- email copyright.ok@ubc.ca with questions
